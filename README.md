# Employee Presence Dashboard

## Purpose
The objective of this dashboard is to analyze employee presence data to understand attendance patterns, trends in remote work, and the overall impact of these factors on organizational performance. This project aims to enable better decision-making regarding employee management and resource allocation.

## What I Analyzed
In this project, I analyzed employee presence data to address the following business problems:
- Understanding the frequency of remote work and its implications on team dynamics.
- Identifying seasonal health patterns based on employee presence to enhance workplace sanitization measures.
- Evaluating attendance trends to inform management decisions regarding remote work policies and office usage.

## How I Analyzed It
### Data Sources
The primary data source used for this analysis includes:
- Employee attendance records, which detail daily presence status (e.g., present, remote, absent).
- Leave records to contextualize attendance data against time off taken by employees.

### Data Transformation and Key Steps
1. **Data Cleaning:** Utilized Power Query in Power BI to clean and transform raw attendance data for consistency.
2. **Data Structuring:** Restructured the dataset to facilitate easy data appending and analysis by referring to appropriate column names and managing different sheet structures.
3. **Defining Metrics:** Defined key metrics such as presence percentage, and calculated work from home ratios based on the data.
4. **Creating DAX Measures:** Developed DAX measures to automate calculations for insights related to employee presence.
5. **Visualization:** Built various visual representations, including trend lines and presence analysis by day of the week, to provide an intuitive understanding of the data.
6. **Error Resolution:** Addressed common errors in referencing columns throughout the analysis process to ensure data accuracy.

### Automation
Implemented features to automate data updates, ensuring that the dashboard remains current without manual intervention.

## What I Found
Key insights from the analysis include:
- Identification of peak attendance periods and trends in remote work, allowing management to adjust policies accordingly.
- Patterns related to employee attendance that correlate with specific days of the week or seasonal changes.
- Recommendations for targeted interventions based on attendance data to improve overall employee productivity and satisfaction.

## How It Can Be Used
This dashboard can be utilized by HR professionals and management to:
- Monitor real-time employee presence and attendance trends.
